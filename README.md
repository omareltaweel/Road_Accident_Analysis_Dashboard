# Road_Accident_Analysis_Dashboard

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create an insightful dashboard that allows users to analyze and compare road accident data across multiple years. The dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights into different accident scenarios, helping stakeholders understand trends and patterns in road safety.

## Tools Used
- Power BI , Excel.

## Steps

1. **Data Import**

-Load raw road accident data, including accident details, weather conditions, time of day, road types, etc., into Power BI for further analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**

-Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, and ensure data accuracy for reliable reporting.

3. **Data Transformation**

-Use Power BIâ€™s modeling tools to create calculated columns, aggregate data for performance metrics, and set up relationships between various data dimensions (e.g., accident type, location, time, and weather).

4. **DAX Calculations**

-Apply advanced DAX formulas to create meaningful KPIs, such as year-over-year changes in accidents, fatalities, and injuries, as well as scenario-based accident trends.

5. **Dashboard Creation**

-Design and develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI, including dynamic charts, graphs, and slicers for filtering. Users can explore insights such as accident rates, fatalities, and contributing factors (e.g., weather, road type) across different time periods.
